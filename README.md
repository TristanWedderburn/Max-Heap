# Max-Heap
Max Heap implementation

Lab description:

In this lab you will write a Java class MaxHeap implementing MAX binary heaps, the heapsort algorithm, and a test class TestMaxHeap.  The heaps will store objects of type Integer and must be implemented using an array.  Each heap may contain items with equal integer value.  Then, the value in any tree node must be larger than or equal tothe values in any of its descendants.
