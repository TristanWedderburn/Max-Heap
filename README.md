# Max-Heap
Max Heap implementation

Lab description:

in this lab you will write aJavaclassMaxHeapimplementing MAX binary heaps, theheapsort algorithm, and a test classTestMaxHeap.  The heaps will store objects of typeIntegerand must be implemented using an array.  Each heap may contain items withequal integer value.  Then, the value in any tree node must be larger than or equal tothe values in any of its descendants
